Calculating the parts of the 1RM formula:

minimum reps:
1RM = weight * ( 36 / ( 37 - reps ) )
1RM/weight = 36 / ( 37 - reps )
( 37 - reps ) * (1RM/weight) = 36
37 - reps = 36 / (1RM/weight)
37 = reps + (36 / (1RM/weight))
reps = 37 - (36 / (1RM/weight))

desired reps:
1RM = 1.08 * weight * ( 36 / ( 37 - reps ) )
1RM/(1.08 * weight) = 36 / ( 37 - reps )
( 37 - reps ) * (1RM/(1.08 * weight)) = 36
37 - reps = 36 / (1RM/(1.08 * weight))
37 = reps + (36 / (1RM/(1.08 * weight)))
reps = 37 - (36 / (1RM/(1.08 * weight)))
